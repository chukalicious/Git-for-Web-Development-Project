  Stretch Questions
  
      1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
            a block element takes the full length of the page, an inline element does not and other elements can be placed next to it, they don't break to another line, like block elements do
      2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
            it means that it position value is fixed
      3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
            using the box-sizing: border-box; combo
      4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
            block: p, div, h1
            inline: img, a, 
            inline-block: i'm going to go out on a limb and say img
      5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
            before, when an element was given the heigh and width properties, and then added paaing, margin, border, all of these would add to the size of the element mamking it not only have the assiged width and height but also the border, padding etc made the element stretch beyond its inteded size. with the box model fix, all those 'add-ons' to an element would need to conform to the actual w + h given to an element and now those add ons do now expand on the element and cannot affect the surrounding elements
